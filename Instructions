hi this is madhav here this would be guiding you to how to place objects in this game please read this care fully 

first we can start with level each time when use a node 2d to create a level u need to conform apply these things
*gates
*lever
*platform
*doors

ok try the test file to get ideas about the mechanics

in objects there are 
			balls
			doors
			gate
			lever
			object
			platform
			and others will be added soon
in playerUI 
	we have energy bar fo petro
	canvas layer with back ground (add this not energy bar)
in players
	we have petro and frend add them in scenes
	
last important point to note 
				when gate is added its lever should be added in the lever 
				if u want to change the direction of platform you have to go to paths folder and change it
				
happy desgining!!
